## RabbitMQLearn

This repo aims to provide a decent learning material for RabbitMQ and AMQP protocol in general.

## How to use

Clone this repo, examples are given in two languages, elixir and ruby (where I had the time to create it in both).

Ruby has one Gemfile per all examples, elixir is an app per example (will be redone hopefully, I haven't used Elixir in a bit).

**GLOSSARY.md** is a list of definitions that can be found in RabbitMQ documentation. It has shortcut definitions and some optional detailed explanations

Examples provided are not exactly "tasks", but rather a way to learn the concepts in RabbitMQ and AMQP protocol. They are examples, working examples, that you are encouraged to try to run and then modify.

`_instructions` folder contains more details about each "lesson" or example (BASICS_02 has no code attached).
