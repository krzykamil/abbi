## RabbitMQLearn

This repo aims to provide a decent learning material for RabbitMQ and AMQP protocol in general.

## How to use

Clone this repo, examples are given in two languages, elixir and ruby.

Ruby has one Gemfile per all examples, elixir is an app per example (will be redone hopefully).

**GLOSSARY.md** is a list of definitions that can be found in RabbitMQ documentation. It has shortcut definitions and some optional detailed explanations

Examples provided are not exactly "tasks", but rather a way to learn the concepts in RabbitMQ and AMQP protocol. They are examples, working examples, that you are encouraged to try to run and then modify.

`_instructions` folder contains more details about each "lesson" or example (BASICS_02 has no code attached).
